Reimagination of a gift I gave to my brother a while back. 

One batch file runs three Visual Basic scripts that simultaneously
>play music continuously from a set music file within dump/

>create shortcuts for two games included in dump/

>open a message box with ease of long-string formatting

>open images from dump/

>kills music once all message boxes are closed

Made specifically for Windows OS, all pathing is relativistic
